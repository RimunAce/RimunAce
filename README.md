## 👋 Hello, World!
I'm "Respire". I started creating Discord bots for fun during early 2018 and continued until late 2021. Most of the time, I used **JavaScript**, which has become my go-to programming language of creation. Currently, I'm just a person that still lingers around to discover amazing projects and stuff created by the community.

- 🎉 Dumping everything I make with half-hearted effort.
- 🚀 Not entirely good or bad. Just being in between.
- 🤖 I took interest in Generative AI for fun.
